#Script for auto Install WordPress
This script create a new folder where install wordpress, create the DDBB and after configure wp-config.php with your DDBB credentials.

This script is a loop, this is: if the folder exist, it create a new folder with a number after your name.

[SETHEREYOURPASSWORD]= set your mysql password
[YOURDDBB]= your DDBB name

Finally, i need know the way that i can install plugins and theme. If someone have a idea for this, please let me know.

Thanks!
